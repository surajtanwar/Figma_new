The uploaded file is a Figma design JSON exported using the Figma API. Your task is to:

Objective:
- Parse this JSON file and extract all prototype interactions between frames or components.
- For each interaction, generate a test case in the required format.
- The goal is to validate the user flow from source node to destination node using Figmaâ€™s prototype definitions.

Test Case Requirements:

1. Test Case Format (1 line per test case):
Each test case line should include:
<Test Case Name>, CLICK or CLICK_COORDS, SLEEP, <duration>, CHECK, <expected_text>

2. Commands Supported:
Command	Description
- CLICK: Clicks on elements with visible text. Example: CLICK, OK
- CLICK_COORDS:	Clicks on specific screen coordinates if text is not present.
- SLEEP: Waits for a few seconds. Example: SLEEP, 2
- CHECK: Verifies that specific text appears after interaction.

3. Rules:
- For elements without visible text, use CLICK_COORDS, x, y.
- The coordinates should be according to the page of size 1080 X 1920 and top left of the page is 0,0
- For screens navigated via prototype links, verify the destination screen using CHECK.
- The text after CHECK and CLICK commands should be in upper case.
- Spellings of the text should exactly match the text in json data.
- Make these test cases in sequence like navigate from source page to destination then start from destination page to some other page etc.
- Avoid extra spaces after commands.
- Save all the test cases in a file(like testcases.txt)
- There should be no comment only the test cases should be in the file

Guidelines for UX: 

1. User interactions must be added in the design, and all possible interactions should be covered in UX.
2. Some models have the token limit 2000 ~ 32000. but the figma design jsob can have text more than that, so we need to filter out some data from design json.
